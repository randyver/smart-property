# SmartProperty - Climate-Safe Property Analytics Platform

SmartProperty is an innovative property analytics platform that helps users find climate-safe properties through advanced GIS analysis. By evaluating properties based on climate risk parameters such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Vegetation Index (NDVI), Urban Heat Island (UHI), and Urban Thermal Field Variance (UTFVI), SmartProperty enables homebuyers and developers to make informed decisions about real estate investments in the face of climate change.

This application was developed by Team El Nino La Nina for the MAPID Web GIS Competition 2025.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Climate Map**: Explore properties with various climate risk overlays for comprehensive spatial analysis.
- **Property Comparison**: Compare multiple properties side-by-side based on climate risk factors.
- **Climate Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize property market trends and climate impacts across different districts.
- **Developer Tools**: Predict property prices based on climate factors and location data.
- **Climate Builder Game**: Learn about climate-resilient development through an interactive simulation.
- **AI Assistant**: Get personalized recommendations and answers about climate-safe properties.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 14 (React framework)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MapLibre GL JS for interactive maps
- Recharts for data visualization
- Framer Motion for animations

### Backend
- Flask (Python web framework)
- PostgreSQL database for property and climate data
- GeoJSON for spatial data
- XGBoost for price prediction models
- Pandas for data processing and analytics

## Climate Parameters Explained

SmartProperty evaluates properties using the following climate parameters:

- **LST (Land Surface Temperature)**: Measures ground temperature, with lower scores indicating hotter areas that may require more cooling and energy.
- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: Measures vegetation coverage, with higher scores indicating greener areas that provide natural cooling and better air quality.
- **UTFVI (Urban Thermal Field Variance Index)**: Measures temperature fluctuations in urban areas, identifying heat pockets and thermal comfort.
- **UHI (Urban Heat Island)**: Measures how much warmer an area is compared to surrounding rural areas due to urban development.
- **Overall Climate Score**: A composite score (0-100) that evaluates a property's overall climate safety, with higher scores indicating better climate resilience.

## Use Cases

- Homebuyers can find properties with lower climate risks for long-term value retention.
- Developers can identify optimal areas for climate-resilient construction.
- Researchers can analyze climate impact on property values across different districts.
- Urban planners can use data to guide climate-adaptive urban development.
- Property investors can make informed decisions based on climate risk assessment.
